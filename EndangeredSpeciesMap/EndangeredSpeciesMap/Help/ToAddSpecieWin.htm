        <h1>Adding new Species</h1>
        <h6>ID Textbox* in the Add Species Window</h6>
        <p>This is a textbox that requires input of species' ID.</p>
        <p>User types ID manually in the textbox.</p>
        <p>This ID defines species internally in the application. This ID has to be unique.</p>
        <br>
        <p>*textbox = blank space where text can be typed in</p>
        <br><br>
        <h6>Add Name Textbox in the Add Species Window</h6>
        <p>This is a textbox* that requires input of species' name.</p>
        <p>Name represents species' name as it is in the real world.
            Example: Tiger, Dolphin, Tomato etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            There can be multiple names in the tables of species, but every species must have unique ID in the application.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>*textbox = blank space where text can be typed in</p>
        <br><br>
        <h6>Add Description Textbox in the Add Species Window</h6>
        <p>This is a textbox* that requires input of species' description.</p>
        <p>Description contains details about the species.</p>
        <br>
        <p>*textbox = blank space where text can be typed in</p>
        <h6>Select type of specie</h6>
        <p>While adding a new species, user can choose a type of species from the combobox (menu).</p>
        <p>User can only choose those types that are already added before from the main menu -> Types of species (Only existing types will be offered in the combobox).</p>
        <p>If combobox is empty, user can't add a new species, because there are no defined types.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h6>Status of Endangerment</h6>
        <p>
            Status of Endangerment Combobox allows user to choose the type of endangerment for the species user wants to add.
        </p>
        <p>
            User can choose one status of endangerment:
            <ul>
                <li>Critically Endangered</li>
                <li>Endangered</li>
                <li>Vulnerable</li>
                <li>Dependent on the habitat</li>
                <li>Close to risk</li>
                <li>Smallest risk</li>
                <li>Isolated</li>
                <li>Partially habituate</li>
                <li>Habituated</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <h6>IUCN List</h6>
        <p>User can check if the species is on the IUCN list or not (checked for yes, unchecked for no).</p>
        <p>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (also known as the IUCN Red List or Red Data List), founded in 1965, has evolved to become the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species. 
        <br>It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world.
        <br> With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. 
        <br>A series of Regional Red List are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h6>Tourist Status Combobox</h6>
        <p>User can choose tourist status from the combobox (menu).</p>

                <li>Isolated - Species lives isolated from the humans.</li>
                <li>Partially Habituate - Species lives isolated in some areas, but can be found partially habituated in humans' presence.</li>
                <li>Habituate - Species lives entirelly in humans' presence.</li>
